## Setup
On Linux, add the dist directory to your PATH by adding the following line to your shell profile file (e.g., .bash_profile or .zshrc), replacing /path/to/dist with the actual path to the dist directory:

export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/dist
After adding the dist directory to your PATH, you should be able to run your Python script as an executable from anywhere on your computer by typing its name (without the .py extension) and pressing Enter.
